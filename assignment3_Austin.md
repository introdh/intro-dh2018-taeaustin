The first step in making my story map was to gather every step I took on campus for a week. I had to ensure that I stayed up to date with everything, and with the lifestyle I live, it was easy and simple. I gathered my longitude and latitude from each location and put it down onto my Spatial data. After that, I went into my story map and started creating my threads. First, I transferred all of my information from the excel sheet onto my story map. From the data I found, I noticed that I did not move a lot throughout campus. Primarily, the two locations I found myself in were my room or in Robins. Once the locations where added, I started on my week, beginning with Monday. When creating my slides, I used the map to zoom into a specific location. For example, on the initial slide there is a regular map of the campus and on the next slide I talked specifically about Jeter. I would then use the map and zoom in on Jeter Hall, so you can see my location. Another technique I used is using a picture with my location. If I talked about a location I visited, you can click onto the highlight place and see a real picture of the location. Also, I used videos to help you better understand and visualize my life as a student athlete. In conclusion, my story map consisted of excessive visits to the Robins Center, Jeter Hall, and the football field. Knowing this I could use my option on the map settings to help you see a close up of the location I have been too.

Space and place are two concepts that are different in how you view them. Space is something that existed in thought but not being physically there. In contrast, place is how people are connected to a certain location. My story map emphasizes space. I am in my first semester at Richmond, so I have not adjusted to the living conditions. There are not many things I do of the field, and this affects me because my story map is not very diverse. I am not drawn in on a certain place on campus or have any true feelings towards a location which makes me give off a broad statement about it. In the future of things, I would like to do it in a location where I have greater memories at.

With mapping I did not change around my dots on my location because my standings were not scattered. If I was to do it, I would have two huge dots on the Robins center and Jeter Hal since that is primarily where I stay.
