# Network

*My network deals with supreme cases involving discrimination and desegregation. I used the supreme court case history to find out more about my topic. The first case I studied focused on employment discrimination in the workforce – specifically, focused on how race, age, religion, illegitimacy, are affected in working conditions. Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen et al v. Howard et al. is a case that exemplifies discrimination. This case argues against racial, ethnic minority employment, and job applicants around the 1950’s in eastern Missouri. Next, I studied cases that illustrated desegregation (other than as pertains to school desegregation, employment discrimination, and affirmative action). The court case of Jones ET UX v. Alfred H. Mayer Co.et al. in 1968, is an example of desegregation and also happened in the eastern Missouri U.S. District Court. This case specifically argues against racial, and ethnic minorities, and the thirteenth amendment. Lastly, I compared cases focusing on desegregation in schools. An example of this includes the case of Northcross et al. v. Board of Education of Memphis, Tennessee, City Schools et al. This case took place around 1970 in the Western Tennessee U.S District Court and argues that local schools should become segregated. Looking at all the supreme court cases, I was determined to find cases that focused on minorities existing at a time that proved that white supremacy was once real and a piece of it will forever live on. With finding these cases I wanted to uncover which time period the cases happen, if the conflicts collide, and find the cluster with the cases. In order to find out this information I used R Studio where it was easy to compare and see the correlation with the cases. On R studio, when I initially began analyzing the data, I studied the years of the cases and if the time period played a part in the reason for these cases occurrences. It was clear that indeed, a lot of cases took place around the 1960 through the 1980s. This proves that these specific types of conflicts are being fought beyond the scene of the supreme court. Next, I studied the plot issue between the cases. The data shown on plot issue is interesting and surprising. There are four major different descriptions of desegregation, desegregation in schools, employment discrimination, and federal or state consumer. When viewing the graph it’s clear that there are examples of each. In handling segregation, you would have initially believed everything started in the center of one specific case and then branch off. Instead it shows that everything separate in the four distinct categories. Finally, I studied the cluster of the cases. The table shows that there are 8 different clusters showing different colors for each cluster and all of the cases. After viewing the data, you are able to clearly see the connection between the important cases that have made an impact on the supreme court.  In conclusion, “These cases build on one another within a complex network of Supreme Court precedents which can be constructed.” (The authority of supreme court precedent” by James H. Fowler, Sangrick Jeon) The complex network is a social network that uses 30, 288 thoughts and ideas written by the U.S. Supreme Court about specific cases. This network proves as an important tool in explaining the what and how by which the cases correlate – which is essential in continuing further research and how to grow from these past court cases.
